# SimbiconJS
SimbiconJS is a javascript implementation of SIMple BIped locomotion CONtrol ([SIMBICON](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/papers/Simbicon.htm)).

It uses my (work-in-progress) articulated character control and rendering library, [coach.js](https://github.com/mfirmin/coach.js/).

The underlying physics engine is [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/) (The JS version of [Bullet](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/))
